# Tutorial: Reinforcement Learning for Character Animation
In this tutorial, we explore the basics of reinforcement learning, focusing particularly on Policy Gradient methods. We'll learn about the theory and gain hands-on experience with practical implementation as covered in [CS285](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/). By the end, our goal is to apply these foundational concepts to the generation of motion by reimplementing the methods from papers such as [AMP](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/AMP/index.html), [ASE](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/ASE/index.html), [PADL](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/PADL/), and [CALM](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/calm/).

Within this repository,  Our implementations will be based on the work provided at [Xpeng's GitHub repository for reinforcement learning assignments](https://github.com/xbpeng/rl_assignments).
